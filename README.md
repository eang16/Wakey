# Wakey
By: Jonathan Hendrickson, Peter Saksommon, Eshin Ang

## Purpose
Our application “Wakey” is an alternative alarm clock application that users can use instead of the built in alarm application that come with their phones. Wakey will allow users to set up alarms and config it however they prefer i.e. setting volume, vibration, snooze duration, and ringtone, along with a “Task” feature that aims at helping users who struggle to wake up. This functionality forces user to complete a task in order to turn off their alarms.

## Instructions
**1. Wakey homescreen**

Tap on the 'add' button to add a new alarm

Tap on each of the scheduled alarm to edit it, turn it on/off, or delete it

# Limitations
1. Wakey alarm is inaccurate and the alarm may be off by few seconds to 5 minutes as we did not use Alarm Clock and Alarm Receiver in the first place to set the alarm.

2. The logic behind Math Solver requires the user to solve math from left to right and ignore the order of operations such as performing multiplication and division first.
